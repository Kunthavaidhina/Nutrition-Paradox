# Nutrition-Paradox
This project explores the global coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition—a nutritional paradox impacting millions across countries, age groups, and genders. Leveraging publicly available WHO datasets, the analysis aims to unearth meaningful patterns in obesity and malnutrition trends from 2012 to 2022.
Data Sources: 
Obesity (Adults & Children):
NCD_BMI_30C – Adults (BMI ≥ 30)
NCD_BMI_PLUS2C – Children
Malnutrition (Adults & Children):
NCD_BMI_18C – Adults (BMI < 18.5)
NCD_BMI_MINUS2C – Children
These datasets are integrated and processed to generate two final structured tables: df_obesity and df_malnutrition.
