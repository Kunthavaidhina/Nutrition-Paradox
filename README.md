# Nutrition-Paradox
This project explores the global coexistence of undernutrition and overnutritionâ€”a nutritional paradox impacting millions across countries, age groups, and genders. Leveraging publicly available WHO datasets, the analysis aims to unearth meaningful patterns in obesity and malnutrition trends from 2012 to 2022.
